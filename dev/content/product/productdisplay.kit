                <p>A Tenon Saw is a large backsaw used for making deep, accurate cuts in furniture joinery. It should make straight, fast cuts without binding. Based on a classic Henry Disston model from the early 20th century, our Tenon Saws have Maple handles, Brass fittings, and stout ¾" x ¼" milled Brass backs. These saws are solid, well balanced and smooth cutting. Filed rip for cutting tenons, which is with the grain.</p>

                <p>A Dovetail Saw is a small backsaw with thin blade, fine teeth, and straight handle used for accurate work (as in cabinetmaking and patternmaking). It is typically used to cut joints in drawer runners, dividers, and stretchers (the framework or carcass of a piece), they are well balanced, maneuverable, and scaled for smaller work than a tenon saw.</p>

                <p>The Carcass Saw is used for precise cuts across the grain, cutting tenon shoulders, and defining the edges of a dado. An ideal complement to the Dovetail Saw. It has 14 points per inch, filed crosscut, for cutting quickly, yet accurately and smoothly. Carcass saws are good general-utility saws for cutting the typical joints used in cabinetry, trimming frame members to length, cutting small- to medium-sized tenons, etc.</p>
